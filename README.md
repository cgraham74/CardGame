# CardGame
This is a fully functioning Blackjack card game.

Created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

My learning goal:
---
1.) Keep my skills sharp by practicing every day.

2.) Create new functionality beyond the base project.

3.) Practice UX/UI with the user in mind. 


My future goal:
---
1.) Create a deck of cards to replace the numerical representation.

2.) Update the look of the game board graphic. 

3.) Replace the hard-coded values for player and chips by prompting the user for input.

4.) Create and add chip representation.


### Original Project
The original project is part of the Scrimba frontend development course. 

This is a great project where the focus is learning to create 
and manipulate arrays and objects in a JavaScript application.
 
The player and chip amount is hard coded and the overall design is overly simplistic (terrible).
