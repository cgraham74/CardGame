# CardGame

This is a fully functioning Blackjack card game.

Created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## My learning goal:

1.) Strengthen skills by practicing every day.

2.) Develop and implement new functionality beyond the base project.

3.) Practice UX/UI with the user in mind.

## My feature implementation goal:

1.) Create a deck of cards to replace the numerical representation.

2.) Update the look of the game board graphic.

3.) Replace the hard-coded values for player and chips by prompting the user for input.

4.) Add functionality to allow the user to bet chips per hand.

5.) Add functionality to increase/decrease chip amount based on win/loss.

6.) Create and add graphical chip representation that will increase and decrease based on win/loss.

### Original Project

The original project is part of the Scrimba frontend development course.

This is a great beginner project where the focus is learning to create
and manipulate arrays and objects in a JavaScript application.

The player and chip amount is hard coded and the overall design is overly simplistic (terrible).
